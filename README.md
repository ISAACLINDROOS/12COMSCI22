# 12COMSCI22

You are going to plan, design and create a web app concept as a functional prototype which allows users (students, parents and teachers) to view, vote on and provide feedback on food served during the 2022 SEPTEMBER TECH EXTRAVAGANZA event in JPC. 
You are encouraged to be most creative, patient with your client(s) (year 12 food technology students) critiques and flexible with their requests and feedback. 

Your clients (food technology students) will critique your initial design and request modifications to suit their exhibit needs on the day.  
This may include variation of colour themes, font choices, text and images included and layout modifications.  
You will need to apply the design elements to create an improved, sophisticated and professional outcome (i.e. consider improvements of quality based on contrast, alignment, size, colour, space, proximity, etc.).
They may provide assets (images, videos, text) that will need to be optimised for use in the app itself (a variety of images of different formats, sizes, quality and videos that are too long, too short, or need to be re-shot). 
You are allowed to request high-quality assets from your clients or to provide your services to improve the quality of these assets, or film, take photos on their behalf.  

Expect to go through a minimum of 3 design iterations (stages) and make sure you keep evidence of this process.
